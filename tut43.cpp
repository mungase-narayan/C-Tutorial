/* Ambiguity Resolution in Inheritance in C++ --->

   Ambiguity in inheritance can be defined as when one class is derived for two or more base 
   classes then there are chances that the base classes have functions with the same name. 
   So it will confuse derived class to choose from similar name functions. To solve this 
   ambiguity scope resolution operator is used “::”.
